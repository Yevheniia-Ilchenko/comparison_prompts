Title: Legal & Government Knowledge Corpus for KNOT Extraction
Version: 1.1
Language: English
Structure: Narrative sections followed by 'KNOT' lines in a parse-friendly pipe format.
Purpose: Provide consistent, domain-specific text to test downstream KNOT extraction pipelines.
License: For internal testing only.

Parsing Hints:
- Each section begins with '=== SECTION {NNN}: {Title} ==='.
- KNOT lines start with 'KNOT|' and use pipe-delimited key=value fields.
- Fields: id, topic, type ∈ {definition,process,risk,control}, summary, evidence, source.

=== SECTION 001: Constitutional Law & Separation of Powers ===

In Constitutional Law & Separation of Powers, institutions translate broad mandates into day-to-day practice. Objectives appear in appropriations, regulations, and agency guidance, but durable outcomes depend on repeatable workflows—notice, comment, review, audit, and appeal. Where discretion is wide, officials document reasons, cite evidence, and apply proportionality so that oversight is meaningful and rights remain intact. Common constraints include limited staff, heterogeneous IT systems, and deadlines that compress quality control. Good governance adds checklists, peer review, and transparent metrics that are feasible to collect, interpret, and act upon. Practical safeguards include separation of duties, predictable service timelines, and clear routes for redress. When uncertainty is high, pilot programs and sunset clauses contain risk while evidence accumulates. Public trust grows when notices are accessible, hearings are fair, and sanctions are consistent with the rule of law.  Field note 1: small, reversible changes with explicit rollback plans outperform large untested migrations; track assumptions, define owners for each metric, and schedule periodic policy retrospectives.

Field note 101: small, reversible changes with explicit rollback plans outperform large untested migrations; track assumptions, define owners for each metric, and schedule periodic policy retrospectives.

Scenario: An agency applies constitutional law & separation of powers across regions with uneven capacity. A directive shortens statutory response windows by 30%. Managers must redesign intake, triage complex cases, and expand quality assurance without new funding. The question is not whether to comply, but how to stage upgrades, sequence training, and preserve due process while meeting goals.

Notes: define once and reuse; numbers need owners; changes should be reversible; audits require trails; fairness needs explanations.

Checklist:
- Publish scope, definitions, and contact points.
- Record decisions, evidence, and delegated authority.
- Set deadlines and service-level expectations.
- Provide appeal and complaint mechanisms.
- Track metrics, costs, and risks; assign owners.

=== SECTION 999: Cross-Cutting Governance Patterns ===
In Cross-Cutting Governance Patterns, institutions translate broad mandates into day-to-day practice. Objectives appear in appropriations, regulations, and agency guidance, but durable outcomes depend on repeatable workflows—notice, comment, review, audit, and appeal. Where discretion is wide, officials document reasons, cite evidence, and apply proportionality so that oversight is meaningful and rights remain intact. Common constraints include limited staff, heterogeneous IT systems, and deadlines that compress quality control. Good governance adds checklists, peer review, and transparent metrics that are feasible to collect, interpret, and act upon. Practical safeguards include separation of duties, predictable service timelines, and clear routes for redress. When uncertainty is high, pilot programs and sunset clauses contain risk while evidence accumulates. Public trust grows when notices are accessible, hearings are fair, and sanctions are consistent with the rule of law.  Field note 999: small, reversible changes with explicit rollback plans outperform large untested migrations; track assumptions, define owners for each metric, and schedule periodic policy retrospectives.
Governance Patterns: proportionality; due process; transparency; accountability; participation; legality; efficiency; equity; evidence use.
Checklist:
- Publish scope, definitions, and contact points.
- Record decisions, evidence, and delegated authority.
- Set deadlines and service-level expectations.
- Provide appeal and complaint mechanisms.
- Track metrics, costs, and risks; assign owners.
